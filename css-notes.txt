Font Selection is Important
Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.

The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.

##The CSS font-family Property
In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.

The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma.

##Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:
    
    1) Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
    
    2) Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.

    3) Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 

    4) Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.

    5) Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.


#Color
The color property specifies the color of text.

Tip: Use a background color combined with a text color that makes the text easy to read.
