        <p> Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light reaching Earth's atmosphere passes
            through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the form of
            infrared heat. About <span style="font-weight: bold;">90 percent</span> of this heat is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward
            the surface.</p>

        <p>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the
            "greenhouse effect" â€” warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.</p>

        <p>Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in
            the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as
            "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes
            in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."</p>
